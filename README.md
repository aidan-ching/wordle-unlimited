# Wordle Unlimited
This is a Wordle clone that I created with a few extra features to make it friendlier for people wanting to practice their Wordle skills. A time system has been introduced, and will start when the first input is detected. Players can either use their keyboards or the virutal one on the site. The solution is randomized each time, so players can play as many times as they want to.

## How to use
There is a github pages deployment that can be accessed on the sidebar, or use `npm start` in command line after cloning the repository to your system.
